## Installation

1. Download the latest release of **coffeetose-theme.zip** file: [Releases Page](https://github.com/aakashsinghbais/coffeetose/releases)
1. Extract it to the .themes folder in home/username/ directory. (Press `CTRL`+`H` if .themes is not visible), if still not visible, then create a new folder by the name **.themes**.
> NOTE: Folders with names starting with `.` are by default hidden, to unhide them, we need to press `CTRL` + `H`.
1. Open Gnome Tweak Tool, if not already installed, install it using the command: 
  ```
  sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
  ```
4. Open Gnome Tweaks, under the **Appearance** tab, change the **Applications** theme to **Coffeetose-Theme** from the drop-down.

That's all Enjoy!
